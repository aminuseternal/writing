# writing
This is a current short story collection I am working on, its still fiarly early on in development as its missing about two or more storiesthat have yet to be written. 
So that means it is still a little bit messy. there will be spelling errors and just pretty basic backgounds and other extras 

Why Twine? 
I wanted to experiment with different mediums for writing. Spurned on by the struggle of the everlasting proper nouns of fantasy which are often wordy and unexplained etc.
so using the power of tooltips, the problem is cirumvented, im still working on the final tool tips themselves, and there are several missing, but they will give details on races, countires terms, etc. 

Where does the story take place? 
It takes place in the World of Alstereth, a setting I have been working on for quite some time now

Um I think thats mostly it, thanks for reading, hope you enjoy, and feedback can be sent to: aminuseternal@gmail.com
